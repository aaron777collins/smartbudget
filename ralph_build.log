   - Created `/home/ubuntu/repos/smartbudget/.env` with production configuration
   - Set `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://budget.aaroncollins.info`
   - Generated secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Configured GitHub OAuth with credentials from deployment plan
   - Added Anthropic API key for Claude AI integration
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Supabase DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL contain placeholders - need actual connection string with password for project `cwrtmqnepuvgofifvmux`

2. **Task 1.2 - Uploads directory** ✅
   - Created `uploads/` with subdirectories: `csv/`, `ofx/`, `temp/`
   - Set proper permissions (755)
   - Added `.gitkeep` files to preserve structure
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude uploads/

3. **Task 1.3 - Next.js Docker config** ✅
   - Added `output: 'standalone'` to `next.config.js` for Docker optimization
   - Verified existing configuration (images, Sentry, security headers) is Docker-compatible

### Commit:
- Created commit `6ea1bb3`: "Complete Phase 1 infrastructure setup (Tasks 1.1-1.3)"
- Updated progress file with completed tasks and blockers

### Status:
- **Tasks completed**: 3 of 46 (Phase 1 complete)
- **Tasks remaining**: 43
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS (correctly maintained)

### Next Steps:
The next iteration should work on **Phase 2: Docker Infrastructure** starting with Task 2.1 (Create Dockerfile).

[0;34m══════════════════ ITERATION 2 ══════════════════[0m

Perfect! Task 2.1 has been successfully completed:

## Summary

**Task Completed**: Task 2.1 - Create Dockerfile (multi-stage build)

**What was done**:
- Created `/home/ubuntu/repos/smartbudget/Dockerfile` with a comprehensive multi-stage build configuration
- Implemented 4 build stages: base (node:20-alpine), deps (dependencies), builder (Prisma + Next.js), runner (production)
- Configured non-root user (nextjs:nodejs, uid 1001, gid 1001) for security
- Set up proper file ownership and permissions
- Created uploads directory structure in the container
- Configured environment variables for production
- Updated progress file to mark Task 2.1 as complete
- Committed changes to git

**Next Task**: Task 2.2 - Create .dockerignore file

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS (still many tasks remaining in the deployment plan)

[0;32mIteration 2 complete[0m

## Ralph Iteration Summary

**Task Completed**: Task 2.2 - Create .dockerignore file

**What was done**:
- Created comprehensive .dockerignore file at `/home/ubuntu/repos/smartbudget/.dockerignore`
- Excluded all unnecessary files from Docker build context:
  - Dependencies (node_modules/)
  - Build outputs (.next/, out/, build/)
  - Environment files (all .env variants)
  - Testing infrastructure (e2e/, coverage/, test files)
  - Documentation (*.md except README)
  - IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
  - Version control (.git/, .github/)
  - Uploads directory (will be volume-mounted)
  - Logs and temporary files
  - Prisma migrations history
  - Docker configuration files themselves
- Updated progress file marking Task 2.2 as complete
- Committed changes to git repository

**Impact**: This optimizes Docker builds by reducing build context size and excluding files that will either be regenerated during build or provided at runtime.

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS (5 of 46 tasks completed)

**Next task**: Task 2.3 - Create docker-compose.yml

[0;32mIteration 3 complete[0m

- Phase 11: Tasks 11.1-11.7 are [ ] (7 pending - marked as "Optional Enhancements (Future)")

There are still many uncompleted tasks, so the Status should remain IN_PROGRESS.

## Summary

I've successfully completed **Task 2.3: Create docker-compose.yml** for the SmartBudget deployment. 

### What was done:
- Created a production-ready `docker-compose.yml` file with all required specifications:
  - Service name: smartbudget-app
  - Container name: smartbudget-app
  - Port mapping: 3002:3000
  - Environment variables loaded from .env
  - Volume mount for file uploads
  - Connection to external "internal" network for Caddy integration
  - Restart policy: unless-stopped
  - Health check using wget (Alpine Linux compatible)

### Changes committed:
- `docker-compose.yml` (new file, 30 lines)
- `SMARTBUDGET_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_PROGRESS.md` (updated to mark Task 2.3 complete)

### Next task:
Task 2.4: Test Docker build locally - This will verify the Docker configuration works correctly before moving to database setup and deployment phases.

The deployment plan remains IN_PROGRESS with 6 tasks completed out of many remaining tasks across 11 phases.

[0;34m══════════════════ ITERATION 6 ══════════════════[0m

Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished and what's blocking further progress.

## Summary

I've successfully completed **Task 4.1 and 4.2: GitHub OAuth Authentication** from Phase 4 of the deployment plan.

### What Was Accomplished

**GitHub OAuth Integration (Tasks 4.1 & 4.2)**
- ✅ Added GitHub OAuth provider to NextAuth configuration (src/auth.ts:4)
- ✅ Configured GitHub provider with GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET from .env
- ✅ Added GitHub login button to sign-in page (src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx:77-86)
- ✅ Implemented OAuth flow handler with proper callback URL routing
- ✅ Added visual divider between OAuth and credentials login options
- ✅ Used lucide-react Github icon for consistent branding
- ✅ Verified no type errors in authentication code
- ✅ Committed changes with detailed commit message (d389095)
- ✅ Updated progress file to reflect completion (30e7c29)

### Current Progress Status

**Completed Phases:**
- Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Infrastructure (Tasks 1.1-1.3) ✅
- Phase 2: Docker Infrastructure (Tasks 2.1-2.4) ✅
- Phase 4: Authentication Configuration (Tasks 4.1-4.2) ✅

**Total Progress:** 9 of 46 tasks complete (19.6%)

### Critical Blocker

**All remaining tasks (Phases 3, 5-10) are blocked** by a missing Supabase database password:

- **What's needed:** Database password for Supabase project "returnzie" (cwrtmqnepuvgofifvmux)
- **Where to get it:** Supabase web dashboard → Project Settings → Database
- **Current state:** Project is linked via CLI, but password not retrievable programmatically
- **Impact:** Cannot run database migrations, cannot deploy application, cannot proceed with testing

**Format needed in .env:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.cwrtmqnepuvgofifvmux:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.cwrtmqnepuvgofifvmux:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```

### Next Steps

The next iteration should:
1. Obtain Supabase database password from web dashboard
2. Update .env file with actual connection strings
3. Proceed with Phase 3: Database Setup (Tasks 3.1-3.3)
4. Continue with Caddy configuration and deployment (Phases 5-10)

The implementation is ready and waiting for the database credentials to continue.

2. ✅ Verified the backup was created successfully (1.9K file size)
3. ✅ Documented the backup location: `~/webstack/caddy/Caddyfile.backup-20260114-171243`
4. ✅ Updated progress file to mark task as complete
5. ✅ Committed the changes with descriptive message

**Current Status:**
- Total tasks: 46
- Completed: 10 [x]
- Remaining: 36 [ ]
- Status: IN_PROGRESS (correctly maintained)

**Next task:** Task 5.2 (Add SmartBudget configuration block to Caddyfile) will be handled in the next iteration.

## Summary

I successfully completed **Task 7.4: Test Application Accessibility** from the SmartBudget deployment plan.

### What Was Done:

1. **Fixed Critical Auth Error**: The application was experiencing `UntrustedHost` errors from NextAuth.js because the production URL wasn't trusted. I fixed this by adding `trustHost: true` to the NextAuth configuration in `/home/ubuntu/repos/smartbudget/src/auth.ts:337`.

2. **Rebuilt and Restarted Container**: After fixing the auth configuration, I rebuilt the Docker image and restarted the smartbudget-app container to apply the changes.

3. **Verified Application Accessibility**:
   - ✅ HTTPS working at https://budget.aaroncollins.info (HTTP/2 200)
   - ✅ Landing page loads with full SmartBudget branding
   - ✅ Security headers confirmed (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - ✅ Health endpoint working at /api/health
   - ✅ Container running in healthy state
   - ✅ No auth errors in logs
   - ✅ Caddy reverse proxy working correctly

4. **Updated Progress File**: Marked Task 7.4 as complete with detailed notes about what was verified and what blockers remain.

5. **Committed Changes**: Created a git commit documenting the completed task and the auth fix.

### Current State:

- **Completed**: 19 out of 46 tasks (41%)
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS (correctly maintained)
- **Next Task**: Task 7.5 (Test authentication flows) - **BLOCKED** by missing Supabase database password
- **Critical Blocker**: Tasks 3.2 and 3.3 (database setup) must be completed before most remaining testing tasks can proceed

The deployment is progressing well, but further testing requires a database connection with valid Supabase credentials.
