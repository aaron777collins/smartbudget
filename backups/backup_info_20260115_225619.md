# Database Backup - Pre-Deployment
Date: 2026-01-15 22:56:19
Deployment: DEPLOY_DOCKER

## Database Configuration
- Provider: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Connection: aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com
- Database: postgres
- Pooling: PgBouncer enabled

## Backup Strategy
Since the database is hosted on Supabase (external managed service):
1. Schema backup: Copied to backups/schema_backup_20260115_225619.prisma
2. Supabase automatic backups: Managed by Supabase platform
3. No data dump needed: Deployment doesn't modify data, only updates app code

## Schema State
- Username field: ✓ Present (line 15 in schema.prisma)
- Email field: ✓ Optional (line 16 in schema.prisma)
- Username index: ✓ Present (line 34 in schema.prisma)
- Last schema update: Via prisma db push (commit 4637590)

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Docker rebuild only affects application code, not database
- Database unchanged: Migrations already applied via prisma db push
- Rollback available: Previous Docker image can be restored
- Data safe: Supabase handles database persistence and backups

## Rollback Instructions
If deployment fails and database issues occur:
1. Restore previous Docker container
2. Database is unchanged, no restore needed
3. Contact Supabase support if data corruption suspected (unlikely)

## Notes
- Application currently running and healthy
- No schema changes planned for this deployment
- Prisma client will regenerate during Docker build with existing schema
